# üçï Pizza Sales SQL Analysis Project

This project is based on a pizza sales database and explores various SQL queries to derive meaningful insights from customer orders, pizza details, and sales trends. The dataset is structured in a relational format across multiple tables including `orders`, `order_details`, `pizzas`, and `pizza_types`.
